To launch local instance of site type "docker-compose up -d" than navigate to localhost:8080

The actual site is in the public_html and does not run in a container in the cloud but on regular LAMP EC2 instance

To deploy I usually use filezilla and just transfer since not a lot to deploy at this time. As the site grows we will change that..
