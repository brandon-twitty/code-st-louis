    <h3>Project Mission</h3>
<p>The mission was clear, the legacy system was outdated, slow, not agile, and had serious security concerns with the legacy frameworks and the infrastructure the system sat on.
Myself and a few team members combed through each area of the system and identified the highest risk items that need upgraded first from an infrastructure point of view </p>
    <p>Another area of concern was over all architecture which was supposed to be Model Driven but the concept was destroyed over the years from developers not understanding it's purpose.
    We began to build a traditional service oriented, distributed system with an app tier, web tier and non DoD personnel server. Due to Government inefficiencies, our architecture had to stay with in reason. </p>
    <p>The initial effort of new development, I lead between 15-20 person dev team distributed all over the country delegating and mentoring each of them with tasks to build the architecture runway and new features. The method used to smoothly transition
        users to the new system from the old was the Strangler Pattern in which  an indirection layer was used based on the profile to route the user to the correct application.</p>
    <p>On the infrastructure side, to keep the legacy system running and service members moving, my tasks where to upgrade the ORM (Kodo) to Data Nucleus, upgrade Java 6 to Java 8, upgrade Weblogic 10.3.6 to
        12c, convert Ant build scripts to Maven and a few other things I am forgetting</p>
    <p>My team built Proof Of Concepts, broke the work down into Enablers and managed them in VersionOne mentoring and guiding several Scrum teams to complete both new development and legacy infrastructure maintenance</p>
