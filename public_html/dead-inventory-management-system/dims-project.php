    <h3>Project Mission</h3>
    <p>
        Dead Inventory Management System was the first and only market place for Maintenance Repair Automation parts. It was powered by a proprietary, automated listing tool that would fully
        decorate and list automation parts by the manufactures part number, online, for sale. The listing pages created out of the part numbers generated SEO rich pages for each individual part.
        This allowed for large manufacturing warehouses to list and sell idle, dead inventory online very easily and quickly. </p>
    <p>
        DIMS allowed manufacturers to list for free and we made commission on each sale. Our average sale was $600 dollars and we never saw the part. The market place would print a blind shipping
        label for the part upon purchase for the seller to quickly ship the part to the buyer. The sellers would generate the list of parts they wished to sell by running inventory reports
        on their Enterprise Resource Management system. The report would be exported then uploaded to our system and instantly online for sale if they approved our suggested price, description, shipping weight
        and other various attributes DIMS would generate for the item.

        This tech start up was truly a disruptor in the industry gaining large clients immediately and out grew a 2 man crew very fast. We expanded to one development team in the United States, one
        team over seas, a sales team and a customer management team that served customers globally. Venture Capital comes with an expensive price sometimes. If I rebuilt this company it would be grown 100%
        organic and would be fun making money while I am sleeping again.
