    <h3>Project Mission</h3>
    <p>
        Our team was hired to develop and document autonomous Microervices that would take the place of several, independent, monolith applications. This allows for the client to service different
    size customers, provide better user experience, scale up our down rapidly, develop features faster and deliver immediate, constant value to the end users. True Agile is difficult
    when working with large, fragmented, monolithic applications
    </p>
    <p>
        Being apart of many transformations, including of a country, I took the lead for our team in the exercises that need to be done in order to prepare proper deliverables for DDD and architect a full cloud based,
    distributed, Event Driven Microservice application. An Event Driven Architecture was chosen to handle many complex business workflows and transactions. The development, documentation and execution of the application
        is my direct responsibility. A proxy service I provide the client is the push for change and making decisions 
    </p>
    <p>
        Other duties required of my position include presentations to many stake holders and receive approval on architecture and transformation plans. As the full enterprise is working through this transformation, it
    required our team to get involved with all business units across the entire enterprise that is distributed around the globe. Part of our mission was to centralize corporate functionality
    into the business unit applications to minimize corporate redundant work
